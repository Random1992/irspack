irspack - Train, Evaluate, and Optimize Recommender Systems with Implicit-Feedback
===================================================================================

**irspack** is a collection of recommender systems algorithms for implicit feedback data.

Its goals are to

* implement an fast and easy-to use evaluation of user
* `Optuna <https://optuna.org/>`_-backed hyperparameter optimization
* provide a simple and fast implementation for a number of algorithms with `Pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_ and `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_

If you have a standard Python environment on MacOS/Linux, you can install the library from github by: ::

   pip install git+https://github.com/tohtsky/irspack
